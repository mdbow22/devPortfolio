# devPortfolio

## Description

My personal developer portfolio showcasing my skills and projects. The site is built on Tailwind CSS with a sprinkling of custom CSS to fill in for some transitions and other effects. The purpose of Tailwind was to create a mobile-first responsive layout without using a framework that had built in components to do the heavily lifting, giving me a better understanding of CSS.

## Design

Here's a screenshot of the page highlighting the desktop layout:
